# Project Rainfall

## Introduction
This repository contains our collaborative solutions to the "Project Rainfall," focusing on binary exploitation in i386 systems. The project is aimed at developing a deeper understanding of RAM and security principles crucial for creating secure software.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into directories for each level, each containing the exploited binary, a step-by-step walkthrough, and additional resources.

## Solutions Overview
In each level directory, you will find:
- `source`: Source code or detailed description of the exploited binary.
- `walkthrough`: A step-by-step guide explaining the solution.
- `flag`: The output or key result obtained from the level (if applicable).
- `Ressources`: Additional resources or scripts used in the solution.

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced understanding of binary exploitation.
- Identification and mitigation of common security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical problem-solving skills in IT security.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are part of an educational project, designed for learning and demonstrating security concepts in software development.

## Contributions
This project was made in collaboration with Lorenzo Edoardo Francesco. His invaluable contributions, encompassing insights, expertise, and dedication, were instrumental to the success of this project. His innovative problem-solving skills have been inspiring. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and experience gained through this collaboration.
